## TODO
Jonnew's TODOs for the 128 channel headstage.

-[ ] Analog connections terminating at the inputs to an RHD chip do not need to feedthrough to the next board. However, digitcal connections _always_ should feed through because they need to make it to the headstage interface
 - Is there a way to prevent stubs in the digital feedthroughs that will go the wrong way?

-[ ] Does it make a difference if the header or the recepticle is next to the RHD, specifically in regard to stack height. i.e. is there going to be enough room for the potted chip?
-[ ] Make sure the circuit has _ample test-points_, espeically for probing GND, VDD, REF, ELEC_TEST, AUX_OUT.
