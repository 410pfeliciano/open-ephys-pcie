# eib-128
128-channel electrode interface board (EIB) with electrical and optical stimulation. Designed for large rodent tetrode electrophysiology.

## BOM
The BOM is located on [this google
sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F-KWcdvH_63iXjZf0cgCfDiFX6XXW3qw6rlR8DZrFpQ/edit#gid=1129179247).

## Pinout
The EIB pinout (ADC input mapping, stimulation connections, etc) is located on [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11wRDYOqHN5lPb03yUdfXfK0zvaDYsVetplaNK-R90Gg/edit#gid=663991061)

## Tetrode Connectorization
This EIB uses Neuralynx ["large" gold pins](https://neuralynx.com/hardware/large-eib-pins) to attach tetrode wires. Usage instructions are provided in the [Neuralynx EIB pin Manual](https://neuralynx.com/documents/EIB%20Pins%20Manual.pdf).
